**[Luagram](https://github.com/Propagram/Luagram)** is a [Lua](https://lua.org) library for creating chatbots for [Telegram](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).

It has been designed from the ground up to be intuitive and fast. When using Luagram, challenging tasks become easy, as it not only provides basic features but also offers capabilities not found in other libraries.

Access the documentation through the navigation menu (on the side on large screens or the top button on small screens). It is recommended to follow the order for a more efficient learning experience.

At the bottom of this documentation, you can change the programming language between **Lua** or **Moonscript** ([a Lua dialect](others/lua-dialects.html)) and also the programming style. The *chain* style closely resembles *jQuery*. Choose the option that suits you best. Your selection will be remembered on this device every time you access this documentation. All examples in this documentation are displayed in the language/style you have chosen. You can change it at any time.

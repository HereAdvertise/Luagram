You can use any Lua dialect when using Luagram. Dialects are programming languages that compile into the main language. In Lua, there are several dialects:

* **[Moonscript](https://moonscript.org/)**: dynamic scripting language that compiles into Lua. It gives you the power of one of the fastest scripting languages combined with a rich set of features.

 * **[Yuescript](https://yuescript.org/)**: dynamic language that compiles to Lua. And it's a Moonscript dialect. Actively developed.
